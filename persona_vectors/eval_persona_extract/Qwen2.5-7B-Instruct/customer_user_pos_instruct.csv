   - ""When I try to share my wishlist, sometimes the recipients don’t receive the invitation. Can you fix that?""
   - ""It would be great if the wishlist could be organized by categories (e.g., electronics, clothing) so it’s easier to find specific items.""

3. **Design:**
   - ""The sharing option is a bit hidden. Can you make it more prominent in the user interface?""

4. **Features:**
   - ""It's really helpful to be able to share the wishlist, but could there be a way to track when my friends have added items to their wishlists too?""
   - ""When I add items to someone else’s wishlist, the app could send a notification to let them know.""

5. **Security:**
   - ""I’m a bit concerned about sharing my personal preferences publicly. Can the app allow for private wishlists?""
   - ""Can you add an option to hide certain items in the wishlist if someone else is looking at it?""

6. **Customer Support:**
   - ""If there’s an issue with the wishlist feature, it would be great if there was a dedicated support channel or FAQ section.""
