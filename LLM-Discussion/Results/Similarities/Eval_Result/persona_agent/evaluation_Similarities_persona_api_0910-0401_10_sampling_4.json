This particular angle does move away from the mundane comparisons typically made, such as format or readership, which might earn a one or two point score.\n\n2. **Creativity and Novelty**: The concepts of \"co-creation models,\" \"partnerships,\" and \"syndication agreements\" introduce terminology that isn't commonly used in everyday discussions about books and magazines.

Furthermore, connecting transportation types to broader economic principles is a common analysis that may not evoke significantly unique insights.\n\nTherefore, while the notion is slightly altered from direct comparisons of features or uses of cars and bicycles, it still falls largely within a routine evaluative framework that many would consider standard.

However, while it presents an interesting angle, it lacks a broader elaboration on other similarities between stars and planets. The idea is somewhat developed, focusing mainly on cultural symbolism, but it does not explore other potential similarities related to their physical characteristics, scientific classifications, or roles in the solar system.\n\nGiven this level of detail and development, I would rate the elaboration as a 2. It shows some degree of thought but remains limited in scope. \n\n[[2]]",
